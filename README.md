###  1- At work you are in the middleware team and as such, there is a request from the DevOps team to build a Sonarqube server. 
### The documentation on the process to follow is in the confluence page. follow that and install a Sonarqube server for the devops team.
### The deliverable will be the url of Sonarqube server, the username and password to access Sonarqube.
### Confluence url: https://dataservicegroup.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RET/pages/1978105890/Sonarqube+installation+on+Centos
### username: unixteam24@gmail.com
### password: school123

### 2- AT work, there are documents for installation of various applications stored in confluence, and during the meeting , the obersavation was that some of them need to be automated.
### a- Go ahead and automate the installation of Sonarqube, using a bash shell script. ( we should be able to copy the script to the server and execute it.)

### b- For better collaboration at work, we need to keep the scripts in github. Create a repo in github called middleware-scripts and push your scripts there.
